// JEST:

React Testing Library helps with:
  - rendering components into virtual DOM
  - searching virtual DOM
  - Interacting with virtual DOM

Needs a test runner
  - find tests, run them, make assertions

jest
  - is recommended by testing Library
  - comes with create-react-app

npm test runs an npm script that runs jest in watch mode.

// How does Jest work?

global "test" method has two arguments:
  - string description
  - test function

Test fails if error is throw when running function
  - assertions throw errors when expectation fails
