TDD: Test-Driven Development

- Write tests before writing code
  - then write code according to "spec" set by tests

- "red-green" testing
  - Tests fail before code is written

Why TDD?

- Makes a huge difference in how it feels to write tests
  - part of the coding process, not a "chore" to do at the end

- More efficient
  - Re-run tests "for free" after changes
